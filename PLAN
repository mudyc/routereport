Plan
====

Keep things very simple.

Use cfbuild since it is fast enough.
Own build script maybe. Just basics.

What is needed?
 cloudfront
 S3
 ApiGW
 Lambda
 DynamoDB

Thus, someone can build up a simple routereport app by deploying
the stack but I shouldn't be scared.

code build
cfbuild
deploy stack


Builder user
------------

Quite a lot of different roles..


Strava hidden strems api
------------------------

For activity youcan request for stream of data.

/activities/id/streams?keys=latlng,altitude,velocity_smooth,time,moving,
